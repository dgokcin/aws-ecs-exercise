#### Amazon ECS
Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration
service that makes it easy to operate containerized workloads at scale.  It also integrates
with other core AWS services, such as Amazon Route 53, AWS Identity and Access Management
(IAM), and Amazon CloudWatch.  Establishing an effective and efficient CI/CD pipeline is 
critical for containerized applications, regardless of the platform you are using to manage 
your containers.
